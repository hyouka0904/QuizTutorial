# Lab 02 Quiz app - example

During this lab session, you will address **two bugs** in the quiz application discussed in class. The lab project (courses > software-studio > 2024-spring > lab-flutter-basics-dart-quiz-app) provides the quiz application with pre-existing bugs.

The first part is to **resolve the error** that occurred during the **initial round**, described as follows:

<br>![component](img/step 1.png)<br> 

During the **subsequent round** of troubleshooting, an error, illustrated in the figure below, is expected to manifest:

<br>( 20% )<br> 
<br>![component](img/step 2.png)<br> 


<br>( 60% )<br> 

The second part is to **enhance the appearance of the ResultsScreen**. A comparison between the **original screen** and the **desired outcome** is provided:

<br>![component](img/step 3_1.png)<br> 
<br>![component](img/step 3_2.png)<br> 

Adjustments include 

<br>( 20% ) modifying the **font size** of the title (including the number of correct answers and the question title). <br> 

<br>( 20% ) Additionally, display a **circular background** behind the question index. **Different colors**(Correct -> Color.fromARGB(255, 150, 198, 241), Wrong -> Color.fromARGB(255, 249, 133, 241)) will be used to indicate correctness or errors.<br> 

<br>( 20% ) The **user's selected option** should be represented in a **translucent purple color** (Color.fromARGB(255, 202, 171, 252)), while the correct solution should be highlighted by a **translucent green color** (Color.fromARGB(255, 181, 254, 246)).
